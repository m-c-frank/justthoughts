i will create a system that publishes simple notes.
i have bigger plans with this but this is the start to externalize my ideas.

the next step is to create the script that lets me develop this tool more effectively.
that will be the case when i can automatically add this repo itself as a submodule and use the different branches to act as the directories.
this way the structure stays very flat.

but each branch itself will have its own README.md when a new change in the repo happens a workflow will move this branches readme to the documentation pages in the main branch and publish the newest version.
here is the draft: [ChatGPT conversation](https://chat.openai.com/share/cc85351b-750b-45bf-a837-1c854d791f4b)
